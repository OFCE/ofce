## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
ofce::init_qmd()
options("ofce.savegraph" = "_sav")
Sys.getenv("QUARTO_DOCUMENT_PATH")
Sys.getenv("QUARTO_PROJECT_DIR")
knitr::current_input()
getOption("ofce.savegraph")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}


g <- ggplot(mtcars)+geom_line(aes(mpg, disp))

girafy(g)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
